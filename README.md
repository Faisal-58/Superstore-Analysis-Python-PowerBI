# Superstore Sales Analysis - End-to-End Project

**Data Analytics Project** using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Power BI, and Git.

---

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the **Superstore Sales dataset**, offering actionable business insights through:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
- Data visualization using both code and dashboard tools
- Interactive dashboard using Power BI

The project simulates a real-world analytics pipeline: from **data cleaning** to **insight generation** to **dashboard storytelling**.

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed missing values and fixed inconsistent data types
- Checked for similar words using fuzzywuzzy
- Parsed date columns and created derived metrics
- Saved cleaned dataset as `.csv` for reuse in Power BI

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed in Jupyter using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly:

- 📌 Sales by Category/Sub-Category
- 🧑‍💼 Top Customers by Total Spend
- 🌍 Sales Distribution by State and Region
- 🚚 Shipping Mode impact on performance
- 📅 Time-Series Analysis of Sales Trends

> 🖼️ Visuals include interactive bar charts, line plots, and category-wise plots.

## Power BI Dashboard

Using the cleaned dataset, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard including:

- ✅ Regional and state-wise sales insights
- ✅ Top-performing categories and products
- ✅ Filters for Order Date and Category
- ✅ KPI Cards for Total Sales, Sales YOY Growth, Total Orders, Distinct Customers and Avg. Order Value (**Using DAX**)
